My sinatra portfolio project is designed to help people catalogue their "epiphanies".  The concept is based on many popular blogging websites we commonly use.  

Users can signup, login and logout of the site.  There are full CRUD commands for the user once they do login, and the site is secured with bcrypt.  There are validations for every view page of the program, and so other users cannot simply go to a webpage and delete someone elses epiphanies.

This was a labor of love, and I am looking forward to having my family attempt to "break" the program.  I'm also excited/scared of what kinds of epiphanies they will leave on the wall.
