This week's blog is a very simple, straightforward one on how to get the most out of the new Map(); function. new Map(); creates an object of any size, you can choose the length by passing a number of your choice like this.

> > new Map(100);

This creates a hash that will have 100 undefined spaces. If you'd like to set something inside one of those hashes you can do so like this.

>>const newMap = new Map(100);
>newMap.set(1, 2)

This will create a key value pair that looks like the following.

>>Map { 1 => 2 }

Thanks for reading!
