I wanted to create a short primer on System Design and how its approached.  These types of questions are asked much more often than you would imagine, and they are asked specifically to suss out how a programmer logically goes about breaking down a system issue.

I would start by familiarizing yourself with the different components of web architecture.  Learn what the relationships are between a few of the following:

* A hosting service vs a web server
* A content delivery network and why it is important in large scale applications
* A load balancer and why it is important in large scale applications
* How many reads and writes your application makes and how that would change as it scales
* What the differences are between types of databases

These are a few fundamental questions and I will spend time delving into each as I move through this series.

I also want to leave you with a hypothetical question that you can mull over.

"How would you design a parking lot?"

This is an important question because while you may think this is a straightforward answer, there is quite a bit that goes into it.  Think about the check in procedure, the structure of the lot, who will work there and how they are organized.
