I thought that for my Javascript project I'd do a very simple photo sharing application.  Something simple that shows off my ability to build a app with a Rails backend and a Javascript frontend.  The project involves JS classes, renders photos and users and allows the user to create new users.  There are three fetch requests, and all three revolve around the user.  I also used the faker gem to seed the data used in this project.
