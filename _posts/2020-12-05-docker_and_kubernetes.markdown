So this is an interesting blog post because it covers something that many of us Flatiron grads want to get experience in.  This is going to be a simple overview of the technology and what it does.

Docker is a "containerizing" system that takes specific portions of your pipeline and submits that information to Kubernetes.  Containerizing essentially takes portions of your code and turns them into images, which can be deployed much more quickly to your end user than a product that relies on complex infrastructure.  

Hopefully that made sense!

Kubernetes is what is considered a container orchestration system.  This means that once your images are set up, they are orchestrated by Kubernetes in the most efficient way possible so that your end user can run their application regardless of cloud requirements.  You can imagine a container orchestrator is like a conductor of an orchestra who makes sure various blocks of the orchestra are playing in tune.

You also may be asking yourself how on earth do I learn something like this.  Well, I highly recommend youtube as a resource.  There are many several hour long courses that can easily be watched and followed.  These will help you kickstart your Docker Kubernetes journey.

Thanks, 
Gabriel Joseph
