My final project will be an airbnb like application that allows users to log into a site and search for posted room and board.  Their will be a users, host and listing container so that data can be passed to the backend through thunk middleware.  Login and authentication will be handled through my store and thunk middleware.  There will be a user, host and listing class on the backend of this project.

There will be at minimum 5 functional components to this project including the Banner, Home, Header, Search and a Calendar feature.  At maximum they will pass information to the appropriate container and if needed, persistence to the database.  

I'll be using materials.ui for styling purposes and will use react-date-range to implement a calendar feature as well.
