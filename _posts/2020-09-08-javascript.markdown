I titled this post simply Javascript because the word itself has a presence.  People that have nothing to do with programming can sense there is a mystique around the word and the language.  I've really grown to love JS especially with the introduction of React.  The ability heavily manipulate the DOM and work in a much more free form way is both daunting and exciting.  

Hopefully as my skills grow I'll be able to build larger and more intricate applications that really express my vision.  That's what really excites me the most, the possibility of creating.  There very much is a part of programming that appeals to my creative side and I believe JS is the key to opening that door.
