Coming back ot this blog post post redux / react for graduation is an interesting thing.  I've had quite a bit of time to think about the way ruby and javascript differ and I've decided I value both for completely different reasons.  Yes there is the relationship between the convention of Rails and the free form nature of Javascript, but this is even more pronounced that I'm working with a redux store.

My particular style with Rails is very dry and sticks to convention you may find from a generator.  I know this doesn't sound exciting, but I think this is actually Rails' strength.  Things are focused and tight, you can create quite a bit, but things seem more structured, which can be a plus depending on the application.
