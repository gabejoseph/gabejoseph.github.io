My Rails portfolio project implements three classes and nested resources in an effort to allow users to create recipes and attach ingredients to them.  Ingredients can be sorted by low calorie items through a scope method, and allow users to attach ingredients with calorie counts, fats, proteins and carbs listed.  The recipe also allows the user to write out information on how to prepare it.
